For this school project, I applied for elevated API access to Twitter so that I might use tweet content to train a machine learning model that predicts which selected twitter accounts are most likely to tweet a given keyword or phrase.
Using Natural Language Processing, I created a model for analyzing the text of usersâ€™ tweets using vectorization and Word Embeddings, and then built a small web application with Flask that, when provided sample text and two usernames, predicts which user is more likely to have tweeted the sample text.
